## Introduction

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between images of horses and humans. The use of CGI-generated images adds a unique twist to the classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is obtained from TensorFlow Datasets, providing a collection of CGI images featuring horses and humans. The dataset is preprocessed to suit the model's requirements and is split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Architecture

The classification model is built using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Dense layers. The architecture includes ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity. The model leverages the inherent hierarchical features within images to make accurate predictions.
